The best snake from each generation is saved in the best_snakes folder.


## How To Run


Pip install poetry -> poetry install -> poetry shell<br>
under main.py set the population size, generations, crossover and selection methods
Lastly, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Dependencies

Poetry is used to handle dependencies.
Pip install poetry -> poetry install -> poetry shell
